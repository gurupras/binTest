            <p><b>smartphones.exposed</b> allows you to profile your Smartphone CPU to understand
            where it ranks compared to other devices of the same make and model (<b>{{ deviceID['Build.MANUFACTURER'] }} {{ deviceID['Build.MODEL'] }}</b>).
            <p>No two smartphone CPUs are created equal. There are inherent differences between them that
            arise from the manufacturing process. While users expect their smartphones to behave similar to reviews or benchmarks found online,
            they may often be surprised to find that their phones perform much poorer than the benchmarks.
            <p>The reason for this poor performance often stems from manufacturers selling lower quality CPUs at the same cost of the better cpus
              all under the same name and label without providing this information to the end-user.
